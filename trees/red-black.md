# ðŸ”´ red-black

Red-black trees: type of balanced BST with height O(logN)

* Red/black nodes
* Root node is black
* Red node children can't be red
* Null child considered black
* All paths from node to null leaf must have same number of black nodes

Rotation (at a node): maintain BST property while rebalancing tree

Insertions/removals also maintain red-black ordering
