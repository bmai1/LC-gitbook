# ðŸ‘½ what's a graph?

abstract data-type representing non-linear relationships between objects

* nodes contain data values, while edges represent relationship
* edges can be assigned weights, parameters that measure priority, cost, or accuracy

* cycle path: first and last node the same, simple path: unique nodes
  * path length = number of edges
  * distance = least number of edges from A to B
* edges can only connect 2 vertices
* two vertices connected with an edge are adjacent
